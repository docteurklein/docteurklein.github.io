title: using yield generator with mongodb
tldr:  don't even try!
---

`MongoCollection::find` returns [`MongoCursor`](http://php.net/manual/en/class.mongocursor.php) instances.  
Those are iterators.

Why on earth would I use a generator (which **is** an `Iterator`) for something that is an iterator already?  
I can alrady iterate my results one by one, without loading everything in memory.

Well, as stated [in another post](http://docteurklein.github.io/2014/08/12/yell-at-yield/#the-problem),
sometimes you have to do extra stuff on each result.  
Hydration for example.

I could wrap the mongo iterator in a special iterator, that iterates over its internal iterator, 
and hydrates the current result before returning it.  
BTW, there is a class for that! That's what [`IteratorIterator`s](http://php.net/iteratoriterator) are made for.

But Generators are made to [avoid writing such Iterator classes by hand](http://php.net/manual/en/language.generators.overview.php#language.generators.overview)!

## The problem

It's all nice, but this won't work, currently:


{% highlight php %}
<?php
foreach ((new \MongoDB(new \MongoClient, 'test'))->selectCollection('test')->find(['provider_id' => (string)$id,]) as $document) {
     yield $this->serializer->unserialize($document);
}

{% endhighlight %}

And this is due to known issues, that are registered here:

 * [ https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PHP-977 ](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PHP-977)
 * [ https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PHP-820 ](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PHP-820)
 * and maybe others ?

Instead you have to fallback to the pre-generator era, and write your own IteratorIterator:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
final class CursorIterator extends \IteratorIterator
{
    public function __construct(\Traversable $t, $serializer)
    {
        parent::__construct($t);
        $this->serializer = $serializer;
    }

    public function current()
    {
        return $this->serializer->unserialize(parent::current());
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

## Conclusion

Generators are not yet the silver bullet :)
